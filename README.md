Technologies Used
The Real Estate Hub project leverages a robust set of technologies to deliver a high-performance and user-friendly experience:

Backend:

ASP.NET Core MVC - A powerful framework for building web applications with the .NET platform.

C# - The primary programming language for backend logic.

Frontend:

HTML5 - Structure of the web pages.

CSS3 - Styling and visual presentation.

JavaScript - Client-side interactivity and dynamic content.

Bootstrap 5 - Responsive frontend framework for consistent UI across devices.

Database:

SQL Server - Relational database management system for data storage.

Other Tools/Libraries:

Likely uses ORM like Entity Framework Core for database interaction.

Potentially integrates with a chatbot API or library for the customer support feature.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
.NET SDK (Version compatible with ASP.NET Core MVC project, e.g., .NET 8.0)

SQL Server (or SQL Server Express LocalDB, often included with Visual Studio)

Visual Studio (Recommended IDE for ASP.NET development) or Visual Studio Code with C# extensions.

Git

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/real-estate-hub.git
cd real-estate-hub

(Replace YourGitHubUsername with your actual GitHub username and real-estate-hub with your repository name if different.)

Restore NuGet packages:
Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio, or run from the project's root directory:

dotnet restore

Database Setup
Create a SQL Server database:
Create a new database in your SQL Server instance (e.g., named RealEstateDB).

Update connection string:
Open appsettings.json (or appsettings.Development.json) in your project and update the DefaultConnection string to point to your SQL Server instance:

{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=YourServerName;Database=RealEstateDB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"
  },
  // ... other settings
}

Replace YourServerName with your SQL Server instance name.

Run database migrations:
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal (where the .csproj file is located) and apply the database migrations. This will create the necessary tables and schema.

dotnet ef database update

If you don't have Entity Framework Core tools installed globally, you might need to install them:

dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

Usage
After successfully setting up the database and restoring packages:

Run the application:
From Visual Studio, press F5 or Ctrl+F5.
From the terminal in the project's root directory:

dotnet run

Access the application:
Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the console (usually https://localhost:7xxx or http://localhost:5xxx).

Explore the features:

Register a new user account.

Log in as a user or an administrator (you might need to manually set a user role to 'Admin' in the database for initial testing, or implement an admin registration/promotion feature).

Browse properties, try the search filters, and interact with the chatbot.
